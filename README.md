## Instructions

The Tech Returners Doctors Surgery has a hand-crafted HTML website in desperate need of some fixes to its tags. Currently, some HTML tags are correct, but in many places the tags have been replaced by invalid HTML `fixme` tags: `<fixme></fixme>` 😮

Your task is to replace these `fixme` tags with more appropriate ones.

For example, instead of:

```HTML

<fixme>Tech Returners Surgery: Home</fixme>
```

Perhaps using an `<h1>` here would be appropriate?

```HTML

<h1>Tech Returners Surgery: Home</h1>
```

💡 In some cases, there will only be one answer. For example, remember that a HTML document has a single `html` tag wrapping the whole document after the DOCTYPE.

💡 But in other cases, there might be multiple valid tags - in which case, choose whichever seems most appropriate.

💡 **_Don't forget to check any HTML attributes are valid and accurate too!_**

👉 The file for you to edit can be found [here](./index.html).

## Tips and Tricks

On Mac/Linux you can open HTML files using the command line, by typing the following:

```
         $ open filename.html
```

Or alternatively, right click the HTML file and select "open".

Or, use an IDE of your choice, such as VS Code.

💡 You can find a list of different tags and explanations on when and where to use them on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

💡 If you get really really stuck, you can find some hints [here](./hints.md).

Happy coding! 🙌
